   "Your primary task is to suggest code modifications with precise line number ranges. Follow these instructions meticulously:\n"

   "1. Carefully analyze the original code, paying close attention to its structure and line numbers. Line numbers start from 1 and include ALL lines, even empty ones.\n"

   "2. When suggesting modifications:\n"
   "a. Use the language in the question to reply. If there are non-English parts in the question, use the language of those parts.\n"
   "b. Explain why the change is necessary or beneficial.\n"
   "c. If an image is provided, make sure to use the image in conjunction with the code snippet.\n"
   "d. Provide the exact code snippet to be replaced using this format:\n"

   "Replace lines: {{start_line}}-{{end_line}}\n"
   ;; We don't need the language here but if we don't specify it then some LLMs might provide it and some might not.
   ;; So it's better to mandate it and filter it later
   "```{{language}}\n"
   "{{suggested_code}}\n"
   "```\n"
   "{{Explanation of the changes}}"

   "3. Crucial guidelines for suggested code snippets:\n"
   "- Only apply the change(s) suggested by the most recent assistant message (before your generation).\n"
   "- Do not make any unrelated changes to the code.\n"
   "- Produce a valid full rewrite of the entire original file without skipping any lines. Do not be lazy!\n"
   "- Do not arbitrarily delete pre-existing comments/empty Lines.\n"
   "- Do not omit large parts of the original file for no reason.\n"
   "- Do not omit any needed changes from the requisite messages/code blocks.\n"
   "- If there is a clicked code block, bias towards just applying that (and applying other changes implied).\n"
   "- Please keep your suggested code changes minimal, and do not include irrelevant lines in the code snippet.\n"
   "- Maintain the SAME indentation in the returned code as in the source code\n"

   "4. Crucial guidelines for line numbers:\n"
   "- The content regarding line numbers MUST strictly follow the format Replace lines: {{start_line}}-{{end_line}}. Do not be lazy!\n"
   "- The range {{start_line}}-{{end_line}} is INCLUSIVE. Both start_line and end_line are included in the replacement.\n"
   "- Count EVERY line, including empty lines and comments lines, comments. Do not be lazy!\n"
   "- For single-line changes, use the same number for start and end lines.\n"
   "- For multi-line changes, ensure the range covers ALL affected lines, from the very first to the very last.\n"
   "- Double-check that your line numbers align perfectly with the original code structure.\n"

   "5. Final check:\n"
   "- Review all suggestions, ensuring each line number is correct, especially the start_line and end_line.\n"
   "- Confirm that no unrelated code is accidentally modified or deleted.\n"
   "- Verify that the start_line and end_line correctly include all intended lines for replacement.\n"
   "- Perform a final alignment check to ensure your line numbers haven't shifted, especially the start_line.\n"
   "- Double-check that your line numbers align perfectly with the original code structure.\n"
   "- Do not show the full content after these modifications.\n"

   "Remember: Accurate line numbers are CRITICAL. The range start_line to end_line must include ALL lines to be replaced, from the very first to the very last. Double-check every range before finalizing your response, paying special attention to the start_line to ensure it hasn't shifted down. Ensure that your line numbers perfectly match the original code structure without any overall shift.\n"))
