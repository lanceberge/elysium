  This package lets you automatically apply AI-generated changes as you code. Call M-x =elysium-query=
  and request a set of changes, and they will be applied to your code buffer as a merge.

## Installation and Customization

```emacs-lisp
(use-package elysium
  :straight
  ;; TODO bind-key
  (:host github :repo "lanceberge/elysium" :branch "main" :files ("*.el"))
  :custom
  ;; Below are the default values
  (elysium-window-size 0.33) ; The elysium buffer will be 1/3 your screen
  (elysium-window-style 'vertical)) ; Can be customized to horizontal

(use-package gptel
  :custom
  (gptel-model "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")
  :config
  (defun read-file-contents (file-path)
    "Read the contents of FILE-PATH and return it as a string."
    (with-temp-buffer
      (insert-file-contents file-path)
      (buffer-string)))
  (defun gptel-api-key ()
    (read-file-contents "~/secrets/claude_key"))
  (setq
   gptel-backend (gptel-make-anthropic "Claude"
                   :stream t
                   :key #'gptel-api-key)))
```

Use =smerge-mode= to then merge in the changes

```emacs-lisp
(use-package smerge-mode
  :ensure nil
  :hook
  (prog-mode . smerge-mode))
```

** Functions to know:

| =elysium-keep-all-suggested-changes=    | keep all of the AI-suggested changes    |
| =elysium-discard-all-suggested-changes= | discard all of the AI-suggested changes |
| =smerge-next=                           | go to the next conflicting hunk         |
| =smerge-keep-other=                     | keep this set of changes                |
| =smerge-keep-mine=                      | discard this set of changes             |
| =elysium-toggle-window=                 | toggle the chat window                  |

* Notes

  =elysium= uses [[https://github.com/karthink/gptel][gptel]] as a backend. It supports any of the models supported by =gptel=, but currently (9/24)
  Claude 3-5 Sonnet seems to be the best for generating code.

  If there is a region active, then =elysium= will send only that region to the LLM. Otherwise, the entire code buffer will be sent. If you're using =Claude=, then I recommend only ever sending a region to avoid getting rate-limited.

* Planned Features

- Implementing [[https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching][Prompt Caching]] with Anthropic to let us send more queries before getting rate-limited
